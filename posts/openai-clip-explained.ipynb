    "Pretraining on ImageNet[@russakovsky2015imagenet] dataset and finetuning on the downstream task has been the standard procedure in Computer Vision. Although such methods have shown great performance, they have some major limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly, creating high-quality annotations for millions of images is a difficult and expensive task. It would be better if we can utilize a large number of images available over the internet without careful annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Secondly, the methods need to be modified whenever there is a change in the number of classes. Let's say the model is petrained on ImageNet dataset and you need to use it on your dataset with different classes than that of ImageNet. In such a case, you need to change the model head and finetune it to match the downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these limitations can be addressed if the model can use natural language supervision to learn the representations. We can have abundant data in (image, text) pairs and use this data to learn the representations that can be utilized for zero-shot transfer. CLIP[@radford2021learning] by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is one such mechanism for training visual models using natural language. Since it enables zero-shot transfer, we need not be concerned with the number of classes in the downstream task.\n",

    "## Method\n",
    "Firstly, **pretraining** is done using contrastive setup and the pretrained model can be used for zero-shot transfer. Here I present an example of **classification** task. For other tasks and dataset, please refer to the paper[@radford2021learning].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pretraining\n",
    "The pretraining phase is shown in @fig-pretraining. It consists of a text encoder and an image encoder. In the paper, they experiment with variants of ResNet[@he2015deep] and ViT[@dosovitskiy2021image] for image encoder and Transformer[@vaswani2017attention] for text encoder. The motivation is to use natural language to guide vision representation learning. The text encoder processes the descriptions of images and the image encoder processes the images. Text and image representations are obtained from the text and the image encoder respectively. The objective is to make the representations of a pair of image and text close and the representations of image and text across different pairs to be different. Using the data given in @tbl-dataset, the pre-training objective would be to make the representation of the text `A white cat` and the `cat's image` as similar as possible. Similarly the representation of `A black and white dog` and the `dog's image` also should be as similar as possible. However, the representations between text and image of different pairs must be as dissimilar as possible. Contrastive Learning[@chen2020simple] can be used to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Make the representations of text and image in the same pair to be the same and different between text and image of different pairs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this objective is achieved, the vision model will learn to produce features that are similar with to textual features. Here natural language is being used for supervision instead of image labels. The vision model pretrained in such a way can be used in zero-shot classification tasks."

    "### Zero-shot transfer\n",
    "Zero-shot transfer means using the model on the target dataset without showing any example from that dataset. Zero-shot transfer example is shown in @fig-classifier. The process can be described in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the classes to which the image should be classified (plane, car, dog...bird). These can be any class. However, you should be able to represent them using natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add prompts to these classes. In @fig-classifier, a prompt `A photo of a` is used. Experiments have shown prompts to improve performance compared to contextless class names only.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pass the image to be classified through the image encoder and prompted class names through the text encoder. Get the representations of images and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compute the cosine similarities between the representation of images and text. Identify the image of the classes with the highest similarity.\n",
