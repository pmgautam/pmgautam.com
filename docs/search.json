    "text": "Data augmentation is one of the major techniques used when we want to improve the model’s performance on new data (i.e. generalization). It is especially useful in cases where only limited training data are available. In this post we’ll discuss some of the augmentation techniques (besides affine transformation) that help the models to perform well (in computer vision).\n\n\nCode\n# install required libraries\n# !pip install opencv-python==4.5.1.48\n# !pip install numpy==1.21.0\n# !pip install matplotlib==3.4.2\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# import the required libraries\nfrom copy import deepcopy\n\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# set random seed to reproduce results\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# define labels and read images\n\ncat_label = np.array([[1, 0]])\ndog_label = np.array([[0, 1]])\n\ncat_img = cv2.imread(\"images/cat.jpg\")/255.0\ndog_img = cv2.imread(\"images/dog.jpg\")/255.0\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# plot the original images\n\nfig, ((ax1, ax2)) = plt.subplots(1, 2)\n\nax1.imshow(cat_img)\nax1.set_title(\"Cat\")\n\nax2.imshow(dog_img)\nax2.set_title(\"Dog\")\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Original images\",fontsize=15)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutout\npaper link\nThe main motivation of Cutout is to simulate the situation of object occlusion that is mostly encountered in tasks such as object recognition or human pose estimation. We occlude the part of image randomly. Instead of model seeing the same image everytime, it sees different parts of that image which helps it to perform well. The occluded part does not contain any information. In the example below, the randomly occluded part is replaced by all 0s.\n\n\nCode\nclass Cutout(object):\n    def __init__(self, cutout_width):\n        # width of the square to occlude\n        self.cutout_width = cutout_width\n\n    def __call__(self, img):\n        h = img.shape[0]\n        w = img.shape[1]\n\n        mask = np.ones(img.shape)\n\n        y = np.random.randint(h)\n        x = np.random.randint(w)\n\n        x1 = np.clip(x - self.cutout_width // 2, 0, w)\n        x2 = np.clip(x + self.cutout_width // 2, 0, w)\n\n        y1 = np.clip(y - self.cutout_width // 2, 0, h)\n        y2 = np.clip(y + self.cutout_width // 2, 0, h)\n\n        mask[y1: y2, x1: x2] = 0.0\n\n        # occlude the part of image using mask (zero out the part)\n        img = img * mask\n\n        return img\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncutout = Cutout(50)\nplt.imshow(cutout(cat_img))\nplt.suptitle(\"Cutout example\",fontsize=15)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixup\npaper link\nMixup linearly mixes two images and their labels in the same proportion. With this approach the model will be able to see a different image with different label during training. It enables the model to make smooth decision boundaries while classifying the object since we are using linearly interpolated images and labels for classification decision intead of binary decision. As can be seen in the example below, with the mixup of images and labels, the new image will have the labels [0.19, 0.81] which means the class distribution is tilted more towards dog and the mixup visualization also proves this.\n\n\nCode\nclass Mixup:\n    def __init__(self, img1, img2, label1, label2):\n        self.img1 = img1\n        self.img2 = img2\n        self.label1 = label1\n        self.label2 = label2\n    \n    def __call__(self):\n        alpha = 1\n        lam = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha)\n        \n        # mix image and labels        \n        mix_img = lam * self.img1 + (1 - lam) * self.img2\n        mix_label = lam * self.label1 + (1 - lam) * self.label2\n        \n        return mix_img, mix_label\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmix_img, mix_label = Mixup(cat_img, dog_img, cat_label, dog_label)()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, ((ax1, ax2, ax3)) = plt.subplots(1, 3)\n\nax1.imshow(cat_img)\nax1.set_title(\"Cat\")\n\nax2.imshow(dog_img)\nax2.set_title(\"Dog\")\n\nax3.imshow(mix_img)\nax3.set_title(\"Cat/Dog Mixup\")\nplt.suptitle(\"Mixup example\",fontsize=15)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutmix\npaper link\nAs we saw above, the occluded part in Cutout does not contain any information which in unwanted since it just increases resource usage without adding any value. Cutmix utilizes above two techniques to mix the images and utilize the occluded part. As can be seen in the example, the cutout portion in dog image is replaced by the same portion of cat image. It also linearly interpolates the label as in Mixup. As seen in the example below, the new labels are [0.18, 0.82] for cat and dog respectively and this can be verified from image as well.\n\n\nCode\nclass Cutmix:\n    def __init__(self, img1, img2, lbl1, lbl2):\n        self.img1 = img1\n        self.img2 = img2\n        self.lbl1 = lbl1\n        self.lbl2 = lbl2\n    \n    def __call__(self):\n        # sample bounding box B\n        alpha = 1\n        lam = np.random.beta(alpha, alpha)\n        h, w, c = self.img1.shape\n        \n        r_x = np.random.randint(0, w)\n        r_y = np.random.randint(0, h)\n        r_w = np.int32(w * np.sqrt(1 - lam))\n        r_h = np.int32(h * np.sqrt(1 - lam))\n        \n        mid_x, mid_y = r_w//2, r_h//2\n        \n        point1_x = np.clip(r_x - mid_x, 0, w)\n        point2_x = np.clip(r_x + mid_x, 0, w)\n        \n        point1_y = np.clip(r_y - mid_y, 0, h)\n        point2_y = np.clip(r_y + mid_y, 0, h)\n        \n        # refer to paper to see how M is cimputed, in short it is to make the ratio of mixing images and labels same\n        M = np.ones(self.img1.shape)\n        M[point1_x:point2_x, point1_y:point2_y, :] = 0\n        \n        cut_mix_img = M * self.img1 + (1 - M) * self.img2\n        cut_mix_label = lam * self.lbl1 + (1 - lam) * self.lbl2\n        \n        return cut_mix_img, cut_mix_label\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncut_mix_img, cut_mix_lbl = Cutmix(cat_img, dog_img, cat_label, dog_label)()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, ((ax1, ax2, ax3)) = plt.subplots(1, 3)\n\nax1.imshow(cat_img)\nax1.set_title(\"Cat\")\n\nax2.imshow(dog_img)\nax2.set_title(\"Dog\")\n\nax3.imshow(cut_mix_img)\nax3.set_title(\"Cat mixed onto Dog\")\nplt.suptitle(\"Cutmix example\", fontsize=15)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel Smoothing\npaper link\nLabel smoothing is used so that the model can be prevented from memorizing the training data and being over-confident. It adds noise to the labels without modifying the data itself. If we are using a 5-class classifier then instead of label being assigned only to one class, it is distributed among all the classes. As seen in example below, \\(\\epsilon\\) is used to control the smoothing.\n\n\nCode\nϵ = 0.01\nnum_labels = 5\nclasses = [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"horse\", \"bus\", \"carrot\"]\n\noriginal_label = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nnew_neg_labels = ϵ/(num_labels-1)\n\n# after label smoothing, cat gets 1 - ϵ and other classes get ϵ/(1-ϵ) probability\nsmooth_labels = [1 - ϵ, new_neg_labels, new_neg_labels, new_neg_labels, new_neg_labels]\n\nsmooth_labels\n\n\n[0.99, 0.0025, 0.0025, 0.0025, 0.0025]\n\n\nAll the above implementations assume that both the images are of same resolution. There might be some minor differences while compared with the original paper. However the main motivation and results of these techniques are same to that of paper. Please feel free to post any comment, question or suggestion. I’ll see you in the next one. :)"

    "text": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is the idea of learning representations from data without the use of any data labels. Supervised algorithms in vision normally use Imagenet data where the image labels are used as supervision while training the model. On the other hand, self-supervised approaches are designed in such a way that ground truth labels are not required. This eliminates a lot of careful annotation that needs to be performed by humans. This in turn enables the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data. Normally self-supervised approaches in Computer Vision are based on aligning the features of two different augmentations of a single image.\nThe general architecture of self-supervised learning is shown in Figure 1. Here \\(T\\) is a set of different augmentations that can be composed. \\(t^A\\) and \\(t^B\\) are sampled from \\(T\\) and image \\(X\\) is transformed using these augmentations. Augmented images are fed to the same neural network \\(f\\) which generates features \\(Z^A\\) and \\(Z^B\\) for transformed images \\(X^A\\) and \\(X^B\\) respectively. \\(f\\) can be a shared network or unshared. The objective of SSL is to make \\(Z^A\\) and \\(Z^B\\) similar for pairs of the same image and different across different images. Self-supervised learning is based on this idea.\nOne thing to be careful of in SSL to prevent collapse i.e the situation where \\(Z^A\\) and \\(Z^B\\) are the same for every image. There are various techniques to prevent collapse. Contrastive learning and asymmetric updates are some of those approaches. For a review of self-supervised methods, you can refer to1."

    "section": "Motivation",
    "text": "Motivation\nBarlow Twins is a method of learning representations without using supervised data i.e. it is a self-supervised learning approach. It tries to overcome the design decisions that were required to prevent collapse in previous SSL methods. Some of those techniques are the use of negative samples, asymmetric learning updates, stop-gradient operation, large batch size, etc. This paper eliminates the need for such choices and achieves results comparable with state-of-the-art methods. This is based on an idea called redundancy reduction which has been borrowed from neuroscience.\nBefore going into the methods, let’s understand the different types of collapse that can occur. This paper avoids the collapse situations mentioned below.\n\nThe first collapse scenario is the one where the model outputs the same features for all the images. In doing so, the features will be the same across augmentations for a single image (which is required) but it will also be the same for all the images (which is not required). One common solution to avoiding this type of collapse is to use negative samples and make the representations of positive samples (views of the same image) closer in feature space and the representations of negative samples (views of other images) far apart. Contrastive learning3 is probably the most famous method to avoid this form of collapse. This form of collapse is shown in Figure 2. In the figure, both the cat and dog images have the same features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Collapse scenario having same features for all images\n\n\n\n\nThe other form of collapse (not exactly a collapse but redundancy) is shown in Figure 3. In this scenario, the features are different across different images and the same for the different views of the same image. This is what we want while learning representations. But the problem is that the features are redundant i.e repetition across multiple dimensions. We want to avoid this case since this adds redundancy and learns nothing significant. In Figure 3, both views of the cat have the same features (required case) but the features have duplicate entries which add redundancy and learn nothing significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Collapse scenario having redundant features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Required scenario with redundancy removed\n\n\n\nWe want the features for different images to be different but the features for different views of the same image to be the same. On top of that, we want the features to avoid redundancy. This is shown in Figure 4. Here the features for the rotated views of the cat’s images are the same but the features in different positions are different i.e. redundancy is avoided. The loss function introduced in Barlow Twins achieves this and we discuss this below."

We’ll discuss this in detail in Loss Function."

The first part is called invariance term and the second term is called redundancy reduction term. The idea is to make the cross-correlation matrix of features of two views of images close to the identity matrix. When the cross-correlation matrix is close to identity it will cause the features in the same position to be similar and the features in different positions to be different from one another. This is captured in the cross-correlation matrix as the matrix is square and the diagonal elements correspond to the features in the same position and the off-diagonal elements are the correlation between features from different positions.\nGoing back to Figure 4, the diagonal elements will be 1 if the features in the same position are the same across two feature vectors and the off-diagonal elements will approach 0 as the features from different positions will become different from one another. i.e \\(C_{12}\\) will be close to 0 when element 1 from the first view’s features and element 2 from the second view’s features are different from one another. This removes redundancy.\nStill, there is another form of collapse to remove where features are the same for different images as shown in Figure 3. It can be removed by normalizing the features. This is shown below where features are transformed to 0 when they are the same for different images. If they are 0s then the loss function will get large and the features need to be made different to minimize the loss. The features being 0 are shown below.\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nbn = nn.BatchNorm1d(4, affine=False)\n\nt = torch.tensor(2*[1., 2., 3., 4.]).reshape(2,4)\nbn(t)\n\ntensor([[0., 0., 0., 0.],\n        [0., 0., 0., 0.]])"

But when we want to deploy the model in hardware with less compute or time constraints (e.g: deploying models on mobile phones), deploying large models is not an option. We want to have smaller models that perform on par or close to large models but be efficient in computation. The main motivation behind Knowledge Distillation is to use large, complex models during training so that they can extract a lot of concepts from the data and use these models to train smaller models that will be used in inference as they are more efficient (computation and memory-wise) than large models."

Although such methods have shown great performance, they have some major limitations.\nBoth of these limitations can be addressed if the model can use natural language supervision to learn the representations. We can have abundant data in (image, text) pairs and use this data to learn the representations that can be utilized for zero-shot transfer. CLIP2 by OpenAI is one such mechanism for training visual models using natural language. Since it enables zero-shot transfer, we need not be concerned with the number of classes in the downstream task.\nIn this post, we’ll discuss the method used in CLIP. The major achievement of CLIP is that it achieves zero-shot performance that is on par with supervised training."

    "text": "Method\nFirstly, pretraining is done using contrastive setup and the pretrained model can be used for zero-shot transfer. Here I present an example of classification task. For other tasks and dataset, please refer to the paper2.\n\nPretraining\nThe pretraining phase is shown in Figure 1. It consists of a text encoder and an image encoder. In the paper, they experiment with variants of ResNet3 and ViT4 for image encoder and Transformer5 for text encoder. The motivation is to use natural language to guide vision representation learning. The text encoder processes the descriptions of images and the image encoder processes the images. Text and image representations are obtained from the text and the image encoder respectively. The objective is to make the representations of a pair of image and text close and the representations of image and text across different pairs to be different. Using the data given in Table 1, the pre-training objective would be to make the representation of the text A white cat and the cat's image as similar as possible. Similarly the representation of A black and white dog and the dog's image also should be as similar as possible. However, the representations between text and image of different pairs must be as dissimilar as possible. Contrastive Learning6 can be used to achieve this.\n\nMake the representations of text and image in the same pair to be the same and different between text and image of different pairs.\n\nOnce this objective is achieved, the vision model will learn to produce features that are similar with to textual features. Here natural language is being used for supervision instead of image labels. The vision model pretrained in such a way can be used in zero-shot classification tasks.\n\n\nZero-shot transfer\nZero-shot transfer means using the model on the target dataset without showing any example from that dataset. Zero-shot transfer example is shown in Figure 2. The process can be described in the following steps:\n\nIdentify the classes to which the image should be classified (plane, car, dog…bird). These can be any class. However, you should be able to represent them using natural language.\nAdd prompts to these classes. In Figure 2, a prompt A photo of a is used. Experiments have shown prompts to improve performance compared to contextless class names only.\nPass the image to be classified through the image encoder and prompted class names through the text encoder. Get the representations of images and text.\nCompute the cosine similarities between the representation of images and text. Identify the image of the classes with the highest similarity.\n\nHere, it can be seen how a pre-trained model can be used in any dataset without using any image from the target dataset for finetuning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pretraining Stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Inference"

CLIP is widely used in learning multi-modal embeddings.\nPlease feel free to post comments or open a pull request if you think any correction or addition needs to be made.
